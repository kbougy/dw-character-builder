# dw-character-builder
A web application for creating Dungeon World characters based on the hack from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vdpv5x83v87lsza/AAA9EUnIU51g_jRzwJw9ec0oa?dl=0 by Anthony Giovannetti.

## Todos
1. User can create a bard then print off a PDF
2. User can persist their bard and edit again later collaboratively
3. User can create an account, create a character, and hide the character from other users. The User can provide limited access to other users. (Need to flesh out a solid permissions model).
